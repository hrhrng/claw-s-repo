On December 8, the Perseverance rover safely trundled across the surface of Mars.

This was the first AI-planned drive on another planet. And it was planned by Claude. https://t.co/kVbdKWibuP

Engineers at @NASAJPL used Claude to plot out the route for Perseverance to navigate an approximately four-hundred-meter path on the Martian surface.

@AnthropicAI (Anthropic):
AI can make work faster, but a fear is that relying on it may make it harder to learn new skills on the job.

We ran an experiment with software engineers to learn more. Coding with AI led to a decrease in mastery—but this depended on how people used it.
