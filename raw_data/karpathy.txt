nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for <<$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).

GPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has become a bit of a weird & lasting obsession of mine to train a model to GPT-2 capability but for much cheaper, with the benefit of ~7 years of progress. In particular, I suspected it should be possible today to train one for <<$100.

Originally in 2019, GPT-2 was trained by OpenAI on 32 TPU v3 chips for 168 hours (7 days), with $8/hour/TPUv3 back then, for a total cost of approx. $43K. It achieves 0.256525 CORE score, which is an ensemble metric introduced in the DCLM paper over 22 evaluations like ARC/MMLU/etc.

As of the last few improvements merged into nanochat (many of them originating in modded-nanogpt repo), I can now reach a higher CORE score in 3.04 hours (~$73) on a single 8XH100 node. This is a 600X cost reduction over 7 years, i.e. the cost to train GPT-2 is falling approximately 2.5X every year. I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.

A longer post with a lot of the detail of the optimizations involved and pointers on how to reproduce are here:

Inspired by modded-nanogpt, I also created a leaderboard for "time to GPT-2", where this first "Jan29" model is entry #1 at 3.04 hours. It will be fun to iterate on this further and I welcome help! My hope is that nanochat can grow to become a very nice/clean and tuned experimental LLM harness for prototyping ideas, for having fun, and ofc for learning.

The biggest improvements of things that worked out of the box and simply produced gains right away were 1) Flash Attention 3 kernels (faster, and allows window_size kwarg to get alternating attention patterns), Muon optimizer (I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't), residual pathways and skip connections gated by learnable scalars, and value embeddings. There were many other smaller things that stack up.

@karpathy (Andrej Karpathy):
I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from "how is this interesting at all" all the way to "it's so over".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing. And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other. So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago
"The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope.", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated "skynet" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am "overhyping" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.
