In that lens, @mwx_ai stands out for being unsexy and useful: plug‑and‑play agents for real SMEs, an orchestration layer that prioritizes state discipline and tool reliability, and traction that’s hard to fake  3k+ SMEs active, 1,500+ marketplace buys, with support from Google, AWS, and an Indonesian ministry\n\nOur read from a simple pass-through flow: token stays behind the scenes, workflows stay simple. A doc cleanup → invoice draft → risk check ran end‑to‑end with fewer hops and clean outputs. On the economics side, $MWXT on Base is deliberately pragmatic: pay for tools, fees burn, buybacks occur, staking rewards exist, and value maps to real usage instead of memetics\n\nWith ActionFi rolling out in weeks alongside a creator circle and paid activations, distribution is part of the design. The question isn’t whether agents can talk; it’s whether they can deliver measurable work for businesses at scale.
