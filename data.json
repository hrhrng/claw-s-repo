        "text": "First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.\n\nBut I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.\n\nI guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\n\nMore importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)\n\nAnthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.\n\nMaybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.\n\nWe are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.\n\nOne authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.\n\nAs for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.\n\nWe are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.\n\nWe will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.\n\nThis time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.",

        "text": "A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of vibe coding. Some retrospective -\n\nI've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all. This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic \"contribution\" and even its article is longer. lol\n\nThe one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite \"agentic engineering\":\n\n- \"agentic\" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.\n- \"engineering\" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.\n\nIn 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.",
